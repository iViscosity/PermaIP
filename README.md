# Perma IP
A small ULib module that automatically detects and bans people who attempt to circumvent permanent bans by creating new accounts. This is similar to Family Share blocking modules, such as [this one by Timmy](https://forums.ulyssesmod.net/index.php/topic,9087.0.html), but it doesn't actually check Family Sharing, just their IPs.

For more information, [the Garry's Mod wiki](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Workshop_for_Dedicated_Servers) has a good tutorial on using the Steam Workshop for Dedicated Servers.
